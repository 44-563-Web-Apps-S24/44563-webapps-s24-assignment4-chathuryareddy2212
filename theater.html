    <h2> The Proposal  Anton Chekov</h2>
    <p>CHUBUKOV. My dear fellow, whom do I see! Ivan Vassilevitch! I am
extremely glad! [Squeezes his hand] Now this is a surprise, my
darling... How are you?</p>

<p>LOMOV. Thank you. And how may you be getting on?</p>

<p>CHUBUKOV. We just get along somehow, my angel, to your prayers, and
so on. Sit down, please do.... Now, you know, you shouldn't forget all
about your neighbours, my darling. My dear fellow, why are you so formal
in your get-up? Evening dress, gloves, and so on. Can you be going
anywhere, my treasure?</p>

<p>LOMOV. No, I've come only to see you, honoured Stepan Stepanovitch.</p>

<p>CHUBUKOV. Then why are you in evening dress, my precious? As if you're
paying a New Year's Eve visit!</p>

<p>LOMOV. Well, you see, it's like this. [Takes his arm] I've come to you,
honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, to trouble you with a request. Not once or
twice have I already had the privilege of applying to you for help, and
you have always, so to speak... I must ask your pardon, I am getting
excited. I shall drink some water, honoured Stepan Stepanovitch.
[Drinks.]</p>

<p>CHUBUKOV. [Aside] He's come to borrow money! Shan't give him any!
[Aloud] What is it, my beauty?</p>
