    <h1>CHATHURYA REDDY AENUGU does Chekov tonight</h1>
    <h2> The Proposal  Anton Chekov</h2>
    <p>
        The Proposal" (1889) and "The Bear" (1890) may be taken as good
        examples of the sort of humour admired by the average Russian. The
        latter play, in another translation, was put on as a curtain-raiser to a
        cinematograph entertainment at a London theatre in 1914; and had quite a
        pleasant reception from a thoroughly Philistine audience. The humour is
        very nearly of the variety most popular over here, the psychology is a
        shade subtler. The Russian novelist or dramatist takes to psychology as
        some of his fellow-countrymen take to drink; in doing this he achieves
        fame by showing us what we already know, and at the same time he kills
        his own creative power. Chekhov just escaped the tragedy of suicide by
        introspection, and was only enabled to do this by the possession of
        a sense of humour. That is why we should not regard "The Bear," "The
        Wedding," or "The Anniversary" as the work of a merely humorous young
        man, but as the saving graces which made perfect "The Cherry Orchard.
