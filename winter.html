     The Proposal  Anton Chekov

     <h3 class="LOMOV">LOMOV</h3>
     <p class="speech">You see, Honour Stepanitch... I beg pardon, Stepan Honouritch...
        I mean, I'm awfully excited, as you will please notice.... In short, you
        alone can help me, though I don't deserve it, of course... and haven't
        any right to count on your assistance....</p>

     <h3 class="CHUBUKOV">CHUBUKOV</h3>
     <p class="speech">Oh, don't go round and round it, darling! Spit it out! Well?</p>
     
     <h3 class="LOMOV">LOMOV</h3>
     <p class="speech">One moment... this very minute. The fact is, I've come to ask the
        hand of your daughter, Natalya Stepanovna, in marriage.</p>

     <h3 class="CHUBUKOV">CHUBUKOV</h3>
     <p class="direction">[Joyfully]</p>
     <p class="speech">By Jove! Ivan Vassilevitch! Say it again--I didn't
        hear it all!</p>

     <h3 class="LOMOV">LOMOV</h3>
     <p class="speech">I have the honour to ask...</p>   

     <h3 class="NATALYASTEPANOVNA">NATALYASTEPANOVNA</h3>
     <p class="speech">Then smoke.... Here are the matches.... The weather
      is splendid now, but yesterday it was so wet that the workmen didn't
      do anything all day. How much hay have you stacked? Just think, I felt
      greedy and had a whole field cut, and now I'm not at all pleased about
      it because I'm afraid my hay may rot. I ought to have waited a bit. But
      what's this? Why, you're in evening dress! Well, I never! Are you going
      to a ball, or what?--though I must say you look better. Tell me, why are
      you got up like that?</p>

     <h3 class="LOMOV">LOMOV</h3>
     <p class="speech">I shall try to be brief. You must know, honoured Natalya
      Stepanovna, that I have long, since my childhood, in fact, had the
      privilege of knowing your family. My late aunt and her husband, from
      whom, as you know, I inherited my land, always had the greatest respect
      for your father and your late mother. The Lomovs and the Chubukovs
      have always had the most friendly, and I might almost say the most
      affectionate, regard for each other. And, as you know, my land is a near
      neighbour of yours. You will remember that my Oxen Meadows touch your
      birchwoods.</p>

      <h3 class="NATALYASTEPANOVNA">NATALYASTEPANOVNA</h3>
     <p class="speech">Excuse my interrupting you. You say, "my Oxen
      Meadows...." But are they yours?</p>

      <h3 class="LOMOV">LOMOV</h3>
      <p class="speech">Yes, mine.</p>
